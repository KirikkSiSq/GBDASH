# Building from source

Requires **GBDK-2020** (`gbdk-2020` v4.2.x or newer) and GNU Make.

- **Windows:** download the latest [GBDK releases](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/releases), unzip it, and point the build at it. The default search path is `C:/gbdk`; override it with the `GBDK` variable (e.g. `make GBDK=C:/dev/gbdk-2020`).
- **Linux/macOS** (and GitHub Actions): fetch and extract the `gbdk-linux64` release from the [GBDK releases](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/releases), then run `make` with `GBDK=/path/to/gbdk` exported.

Build the ROM:

```
make clean
make -j8
```

The output is `bin/POCKETDASH.gb`. Music playback uses [hUGEDriver](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGEDriver); its prebuilt `lib/hUGEDriver.lib` is included in this repository.
